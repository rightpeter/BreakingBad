                        <h1>Breaking the Habit of Procrastination</h1>
                        <div>Putting off work can temporarily reduce our anxiety about it and allow us to do short-term easy tasks that provide easy instant gratification.
                            However, a continued habit of procrastination can reduce how well we perform on important tasks that help us achieve our career or life goals.
                            In seeking instant gratification, we often delay the possibility of achieving our full potential through hard, persistent work and set our future-self
                            for failure and disappointment.
                    </div>
                        <div>
                            In the following section, we detail some ways in which you can stop procrastinating and handle the tasks scheduled for today. Afterwards, we describe the some
                            factors that can help you understand why procrastinate and break this habit in the long-term.

                        <h2>Stop Procrastination Now</h2>
                        <div>
                            <h3>1. Recognize that you’re procrastinating</h3>
                            <div>
                                You can only address a problem if you acknowledge it’s presence.If you’re briefly delaying an urgent task, that may be perfectly justified.
                                Symptoms of procrastination may not just be spending too much time on YouTube: they could include performing low-priority tasks for a while
                                or leaving an urgent task in your to-do list for several days. People come up with many creative ways to procrastinate e.g. reading emails
                                without making a decision on what to do about them, or addressing other people’s concerns instead of handling your own high-priority tasks.
                        </div>
                            <div>
                                If you find yourself behaving in this way, it may be time to acknowledge that you are delaying an important task that may be giving you some amount of anxiety.
                                Although resolving the source of that anxiety would be the best way to get started with the task, that may not be easy to accomplish soon. Therefore, we recommend
                                some quick tips to get started.
                        </div>
                            <br />
                            <h3>2. Go for a walk in nature</h3>
                            <div>
                                Any form of exercise produces endorphins which help you feel more positive. Walking outside also has the great side-benefit of helping your body produce vitamin D. But other than the great health benefits, it helps create momentum. Instead of moping around at your desk, walking makes you feel as if you are actually doing something, helping you feel more productive and start work more easily. This is similar to the clear-to-neutral technique which eliminates friction and helps you get started.
                                Are your tasks broken into manage-able chunks?
                                Does your to-do list contains tasks such as “Prepare for exam” or does it contain tasks such as “Read Chapter 1 of Book XYZ and solve questions Q1-5”? Tasks such as the former can seem a lot more intimidating as you do not clearly know what you need to do to accomplish them or when the task will end. Breaking the task down into manage-able chunks that can be accomplished in minutes or hours can help reduce feelings of anxiety or uncertainty and help you get started.
                        </div>
                            <br />
                            <h3>3. Are your tasks broken into manage-able chunks?</h3>
                            <div>
                                Does your to-do list contains tasks such as “Prepare for exam” or does it contain tasks such as “Read Chapter 1 of Book XYZ and solve questions Q1-5”? Tasks such as the former can seem a lot more intimidating as you do not clearly know what you need to do to accomplish them or when the task will end. Breaking the task down into manage-able chunks that can be accomplished in minutes or hours can help reduce feelings of anxiety or uncertainty and help you get started.

                            <h3>4. Take control of your environment and remove distractions</h3>
                            <div>
                                Take a look around at your environment: are you studying in your apartment alone where you also play games and hang out with your friends? Or are you studying at your favorite desk in a library or are working with motivated class-mates at a quiet coffee shop? Do you have all of Facebook, Twitter and your favorite sports channel in your browser while you are working?
                                Environment truly has an impact on our behavior. An environment where we feel as if there is no one stopping us from indulging in instant-gratification is not conducive to work: it is best to move to a place where we feel most motivated to work. It can be where we are surrounded by other hard-working folks or a quiet place with no conversation. It is also important to shut down the chatter from our many electronic devices to allow us to start working on actual goals that will help us succeed in life, rather than those that allow time to pass pleasurably.
                        </div>
                            <br />
                            <h3>5. Try doing the task for only two minutes</h3>
                            <div>
                                Once you have found your ideal environment, now you only need to build momentum. Try starting the task for only two minutes with full permission to stop and lollygag after that time is up. Tell yourself that you cannot feel the full impact of that task in two minutes anyway and so it will not be such a bad experience. However, in reality, two minutes at a time is enough to help us build momentum. Starting tasks is hard but once we begin them and momentum is built, we are more motivated to finish.
                        </div>
                            <br />
                            <h3>6. Dealing with anxiety by reaching out to a friend</h3>
                            <div>
                                Oftentimes, our internal dialogue is extremely harsh and not at all reflective of reality. In reality, we would never speak to a friend in such tones, even if we found them indulging in procrastination-like behavior. Therefore, to seek the comfort we are sometimes not able to provide ourselves, it is good to turn to a sincere friend who might provide encouragement and help with reducing the anxiety surrounding the task in our minds.
                        </div>
                            <br />
                            <h3>7. Aim for done over perfect</h3>
                            <div>
                                Finally, when executing the task, aim to create a “first draft” rather than creating a perfect product in the first go. Perfectionism can sometimes be the greatest enemy of productivity: as we internally believe that we will never be able to produce a perfect product, we are reluctant to start work. Give yourself room to make mistakes and create an imperfect product. As a student, if you don’t turn in an assignment, you might get an F instead of an A+. However, if you turn in an imperfect product, you may still get an A- or a B+. Therefore, recognize that finishing something and giving yourself time to iterate over the product is much better than not starting due to misplaced aspirations for perfection.

                            <h2>Long-term Factors to Consider for Breaking the Habit of Procrastination</h2>
                            <div>
                                Hopefully, the methods above helped you get started on work. However, procrastination
                                is a habit that must also be addressed in the long term, just an any other bad habit.
                                At the end of the day, procrastination is about managing your emotions. If you procrastinate because you are lazy, the problem is slightly more manage-able: you need to surround yourself with people and ideas that motivate you. However, if you procrastinate because you are afraid in some way, resolving that fear can be a much bigger problem. We highlight a few sources below.
                        </div>
                            <br />
                            <div>
                                <h3>1. Working out why you procrastinate</h3>
                                <div>
                                    Procrastination can be a symptom of deep psychological fears. Does your procrastination stem from a fear of failure? Or does it stem from a fear of success?
                                    In the former case, the problem can be somewhat resolved by untangling self-worth and performance in one’s mind. In today’s world, unrealistic expectations of work and achievement can be sometimes set up. It is important to untangle one’s belief in one’s self-worth from outward signs of success.
                                    In the latter case, people may fear what would happen to their lives if they were actually successful in their goals. Would their success push them to a place where they might lose their current friends and place in society? It is important to talk these fears out with a counselor or mentor.
                                    Research has also shown that procrastination can stem from a lack of belief in one’s self-efficacy or ability to tackle the task. One way of handling this problem is to improve your self-efficacy. Unfortunately, one of the few ways of doing that is to attempt the task. The other way is to recognize that life is all about handling challenges that we may not feel equipped to handle: this is how growth occurs. By always attempting the tasks that we feel equipped to handle, we will never improve and society as a whole will never prosper.
                                    Or is your problem more environmental, such as a distracting environment or unmotivated friends? If so, try to understand why you are in such an environment and try to modify to suit your goals and dreams.
                            </div>
                                <br />
                                <h3>2. Goal setting and prioritizing</h3>
                                <div>
                                    Set a time aside every week to go through your to-do list, prioritize your tasks according to what is important to your future goals and break them down into manage-able chunks. Build these tasks into your routine, rather than mentally dedicating a full-day to a large project, not knowing how you’ll actually execute it.
                            </div>
                                <br />
                                <h3>3. Forgiving yourself</h3>
                                <div>
                                    Finally, it is extremely important to modify your internal dialogue so that there is less self-flagellation and more encouragement. Research has shown that students who forgive themselves for procrastination on one exam and are less likely to procrastinate on the next. Forgiving oneself reduces the guilt that we feel for our transgression: this means that the less ill-feeling we harbor, the less we’ll run away from difficult tasks and look for temporary, pain-numbing instant-gratification. In addition, forgiving oneself is often accompanied by making a decision to change one’s habits: this is more motivational than choosing avoidance behaviors such as procrastination.
